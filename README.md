# Android_Application_Lichtumgebungen

Masterâ€™s Thesis: We analyzed learning efficiency under different adjustable light environments. This repository provides the Android Application that we used to change light settings. The game application can be found seperately on this github repository: https://github.com/elias1708/Lichtumgebungen/blob/main/README.md. 

## Run the Android Application to change light settings
To run the experiment with light the Philips Hue Bridge and Philip Smart lights are needed. Connect the Philips Hue Bridge via ethernet cable to your router and install the Philips smart lights. Install Android Studio on your computer and connect the smartphone with your computer. Run the Android Application on your phone.
