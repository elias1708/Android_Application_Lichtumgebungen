# Android_Application_Lichtumgebungen

Masterâ€™s Thesis: We analyzed learning efficiency under different adjustable light environments. This repository provides the Android Application that we used to change light settings. The game application can be found seperately on this github repository: https://github.com/elias1708/Lichtumgebungen/blob/main/README.md. 

## Run the Android Application to change light settings
To run the Android Application the Philips Hue Bridge and Philip Smart lights are needed. Connect the Philips Hue Bridge via ethernet cable to your router and install the Philips smart lights. Install Android Studio on your computer and download this github respository. We used 'Android Studio Flamingo | 2022.2.1 Patch 2'. Run the repository on Android Studio and connect the smartphone with your computer. This will automatically install the Android Application on your smartphone. 

The code is located in the "code" folder, which was extracted from a subfolder within the "app" directory.
